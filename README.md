# Gender_Detection_Using_Python

The main aim of this project is to detect  gender through the given data set. We will use simple python and Keras methods for detecting gender. The data set can be downloaded from  GENDER AND ETHNICITY (FACE DATA) CSV | Kaggle.

The objective of the program given is to detect object of interest(face) in real time and to keep tracking of the same object.This is a simple example of how to detect face in Python. You can try to use training samples of any other object of your choice to be detected by training the classifier on required objects.
